## Overview of the analysis: 
While on vacation in Hawaii, I discovered a passion for surfing.  Since that vacation, I have been trying to formulate a plan that would allow me to return to Hawaii to live forever.  I have come up with an idea to open a surf n' shake shop to serve surf board and ice cream to locals and tourists.  In order to get this business going, I will need to find an investor to help me get the business off the ground.  I put together a strong business plan and identified a found an investor named W. Avy.  W. Avy is known for his love of surfing.  W. Avy has invested in a surf shop before but failed to consider the weather for the area and the business ended up being affected by the amount of rain the area received.  W. Avy asks if I will run some data analysis on local weather for the island of Oahu, where I am looking to open the shop.

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze weather data from the island of Oahu to see if weather would be a concern that could affect the success of this business venture.  W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results: 
### The data provided for this analysis comes from 9 weather stations that reported temperature data for Oahu island.  The provided data was recorded from 1/1/2010 to 8/23/2017.

* For the month of June, the data stations provided 1,700 weather related data points.  The mean temperature recorded for the 8 years worth of June weather data is 74.9 degrees.  The minimum temperature recorded was 64 degrees and the maximum temperature recorded was 85 degrees.  25% of the time, the weather was 73 or below while it was also 77 or higher 75% of the time.

The minimum temperature recorded was 56 degrees and the maximum temperature recorded was 8 degrees.  25% of the time, the weather was 69 or below while it was also 74 or higher 75% of the time. 

* Based on the data, the temperature stays pretty consistent from June to December with only 3-4 degree differences between the mean, max, upper and lower quartiles.  The minimum amount recorded in December is 8 degrees cooler than the minimum temperature recorded in June.  Overall, the temperature appears to be steady and consistent and should not affect the surfing business based on a historical temperature perspective.
